Tool to bruteforce a User-Password-Company login using libcurl, it tries to parametrize as much as possible in order to be useful for a lot of sites and quickly adaptable for your needs

## Example Usage
```shell
python3 ./main.py -h
```

## Limitations
```
Memory leaks occur, they may be due to weakref callbacks in Python or rather pycurl (it drives a curl instance and curl has to free the memory it allocated)
```

## TODO
- [x] Diagnose memory leaks;
- [ ] Fix em?
